"WhiteBox" Working title

High Concept:
A simple 1st person shooter based on game quality assurance where the goal is to find all the bugs and report them for points

The basic design:
	The game is presented as a sprite-based 1st person shooter, similar to Doom.  There will be at least one weapon (A basic raycast gun) and one enemy type (Walk toward you and fire).  Each level has a goal to reach to beat it.
	Additionally, at any time you can bring up a debug display that gives you options such as invulnerability and infinite ammo.  It also allows you to mark an area where you think there's a bug by pointing at it.  You can also mark an area by being inside of it.  When an area is marked as a bug, if it's valid, a bug report will automatically be generated and displayed to the player.

Bug types:
	Collision: Colliders can have a chance to not be active.  To find these, the player will have to push against walls or shoot them to see if they properly collide.
	AI: Enemies will sometimes have no AI, and if we have multiple enemy types, they will sometimes have the WRONG AI.
	Sound: The wrong sounds can play from a monster, object, or weapon, or no sound at all may play.
	Performance: Certain areas of the level run slowly; the area that it happens has to be marked by the player.  Bonus if they can pinpoint the exact object causing the problem.
	Incompletability: If a level can't be completed, it has to be marked as incompletable.
	Bonus: If the player gets out of the level, even if it wasn't intended for a bug to allow that, we give the player points.

	Particles persisting after use (Like our bug with the cactus man's blood)
	
Additional stuff we'd like to do:
	I'd like to show the Debug.Log output in debug mode.
	I'd also like some sort of fake-or-real framerate histogram.
